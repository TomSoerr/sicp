// I explored the parallel resistor problem with interval arithmetic, I discovered that different formulas for parallel resistors ((R1*R2)/(R1+R2) and 1/(1/R1 + 1/R2)) give different  results due to the dependency problem. I found that affine arithmetic could solve this by  representing intervals as z = X0 + X1e1 + X2e2 + ....

// For the division part, I came up with the idea to split it into a multiplication A/B = A * (1/B). Since electrical components typically have tolerances less than 30%, I realized I could use a Taylor series to approximate 1/B. This would result in a function f(x,y) where x and y represent the noise symbols. Finding the extrema of this function would give me the interval bounds.
